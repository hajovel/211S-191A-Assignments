            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Haven. I am a Salvadoran-American first-gen and currently a third year Cognitive Science major and Digital Humanities minor. 
            I have an interest in art, UI/UX, game and media design, and education that I hope to explore more! 
            </p>

            <p> 
            I am a CA native, and currently live here at Westwood and visit back home at Fullerton. 
            Some of my hobbies consist of drawing, design, playing video games, and creative writing! 
            And from the many online quizzes I take online that I remember off the top of my head, I am... </p>
            <ul>
                <li>an INFP according to <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16personalities</a>.</li>
                <li>a Sun Libra, Moon and Rising Sagitarrius</li>
                <li>and a Type 9w6 according to <a href="https://enneagramtritypetest.com">Enneagram</a>. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also love cats a whole heckin lot and am a cat mom of one Calico girl! Her name is <a href="more_about_me.html">Luna</a>, my 9-month baby!</p>

            <h3>critical mapmaking</h3>
            <p>As someone who finds it very important to continue learning about critical social issues, 
            I hope that throughout this course and as a critical mapmaker, I can amplify marginalized voices whilst respecting spaces and communities 
            I am not in by not speaking over or misrepresenting them. As a critical mapmaker, I want to create compelling maps visually but also maps 
            that are representative of my goal in always being a good ally to others. As someone who has little previous experience in making a map, I am 
            looking forward to learning and using  maps for social justice and take this knowledge to criticize the maps outside this course 
            and woven into everyday life, now aware of the injustice so many reflect.
